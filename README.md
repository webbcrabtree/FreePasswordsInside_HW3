Module 3 - Random Password Generator

This is my attempt to make a multi-parameter, random password generator. It's not pretty, but it works....at least it worked when I was testing it.

How to use:
1. Click on the 'Generate Password' button
2. Input your desired password length, between 8-128 characters
3. Follow the prompts to determine the type(s) of characters to be used by the generator
4. Enjoy your new, randomly generated password

note: Author does not guarantee the secureness (is that a word?) of your new password, just the relative randomness of it.
